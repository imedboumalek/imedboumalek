I'm a product oriented Software Engineer focusing on Front-end tech, I've started my journey in the services sector
where I've worked on [FoodBeeper](https://foodbeeper.com) and [DZtenders](https://www.dztenders.com) as a Mobile developer,
where I quickly rose to the position of Lead Mobile developer.
I ultimately decided to transition to the health sector because helping people was my main goal. This led me to work on [Pavlok](https://www.pavlok.com) as a Flutter/Android developer, and eventually, 
[Wergonic](https://www.wergonic.se) as a Mobile Developer and Project Manager.

I've also mentored and coached many junior developers and helped them get started in their programming journey,
sharing knowledge and breaking down complex concepts into simple ones is something I enjoy doing. So I've made this blog as well as a youtube channel to add as much value as I can to the community.
